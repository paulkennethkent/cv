Bicester, United Kingdom | pkennethkent@gmail.com

Having nurtured a lifelong interest in technology, I am fortunate to have built a fulfilling career in this domain. I actively pursue opportunities that allow me to work in an environment I truly enjoy and where continuous learning is valued. My objective is to join organizations that possess a strong and positive mission, offer stimulating projects, and foster a culture of inspiration.
